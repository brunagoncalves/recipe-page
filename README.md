## My Process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox for layout
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I Learned

I focused on a mobile-first approach to ensure responsiveness.

### Continued Development

For future projects, I’d like to improve my skills with Flexbox and Grid, as well as focus more on creating reusable components. I also plan to experiment more with accessibility techniques.
